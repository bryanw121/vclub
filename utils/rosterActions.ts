/**
 * The People tab's per-row ⋯ menu (#40). The risky part is the gates, not the
 * happy path: who is offered Message, and who must never be.
 *
 * Messaging is host → attendee only. An organiser has a real operational need to
 * reach one person; attendee → attendee DMs from a roster are an unsolicited-
 * contact vector that needs its own design.
 *
 * Silences are one-directional: `chat_silences` is readable only where
 * `auth.uid() = user_id`, so the viewer can hide Message for people *they* have
 * silenced, but cannot learn who has silenced *them* (that needs a server-side
 * check; deliberately not invented here).
