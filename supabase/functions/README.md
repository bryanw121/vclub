# Edge functions

| Function | Caller | Auth | `verify_jwt` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `send-chat-push` | Database Webhook on `messages` INSERT | service-role bearer or `x-webhook-secret` | `false` |
| `check-push-receipts` | pg_cron every 30 min (migration `20261024120500_push_receipts.sql`) | service-role bearer or `x-webhook-secret` | `false` |
| `places-proxy` | the app, via `supabase.functions.invoke('places-proxy')` | user JWT checked by the gateway | `true` |
| `send-feedback-email` | the app, after inserting `feedback_submissions` (`lib/feedback.ts`) | user JWT checked by the gateway; the function emails only a fresh row the caller owns | `true` |
| `login-with-username` | the signed-out app, via `supabase.functions.invoke('login-with-username')` | none (it is a sign-in); rate limited per username and IP | `false` |

`verify_jwt` is declared in [`../config.toml`](../config.toml) and applied on deploy.
Shared code lives in `_shared/` (`supabase.ts`: service-role client, Expo constants;
`webhook.ts`: request authentication). Imports of local files need the `.ts` extension.

## Webhook authentication

`send-chat-push` and `check-push-receipts` run with `verify_jwt = false`, so they
check the request themselves with `requireWebhookAuth` (`_shared/webhook.ts`).
A request is accepted when **either**

- `Authorization: Bearer <token>` equals the function's `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
  (Supabase injects this secret into every function; nothing to set), **or**
- `x-webhook-secret: <secret>` equals the `WEBHOOK_SECRET` function secret.

Anything else gets `401`. Comparison is constant-time. The bearer must be the exact
service-role key the function sees at runtime.

`WEBHOOK_SECRET` is new and **optional**. The existing service-role bearer keeps
working, so nothing has to change for pushes to keep flowing. Set one if you would
rather not put the service-role key in a Dashboard webhook header:

```bash
supabase secrets set WEBHOOK_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
```

then in Dashboard → Database → Webhooks → the `messages` INSERT webhook, replace the
`Authorization` header with `x-webhook-secret: <the same value>`.

pg_cron keeps using the service-role bearer from Vault (`service_role_key`).

### Limits

`send-chat-push` skips a message id it handled in the last 10 minutes, to absorb
webhook retries. The memory is per function instance and is lost on cold start, so
it is best effort only; a durable guarantee would need a column on `messages`.

## `places-proxy`

Needs the `GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` secret. `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is optional: a comma-separated
list of browser origins allowed by CORS (for example
`https://app.example.com,http://localhost:8081`). Unset means `*`. Native apps send no
`Origin` header and are unaffected.

## `send-feedback-email`

Emails a stored feedback / bug submission to the team (#9). The app saves the row
first, then calls the function with only `{ id }`; the function loads the row with the
service role, checks the caller owns it, that it is under 15 minutes old and that the
caller has made at most 5 submissions in the last hour, and sends it through Resend.
Without `RESEND_API_KEY` it answers `503 email not configured` and the submission is
still saved; the app shows success either way.

| Secret | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | yes, to send | none (503 until set) |
| `FEEDBACK_EMAIL` | no | `DEFAULT_FEEDBACK_EMAIL` in `_shared/feedback.ts`, pinned by a unit test to `FEEDBACK_EMAIL` in `constants/feedback.ts` |
| `FEEDBACK_FROM` | no | `vteam <feedback@vteamvolleyball.com>` |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | no | `*` (same as places-proxy) |

The destination lives in `constants/feedback.ts`. To change it, edit that constant and
the function default (the test fails until both match) and redeploy, or set the
`FEEDBACK_EMAIL` secret, which takes effect without a release.

Resend setup: create an API key (Sending access), add the sending domain
(`vteamvolleyball.com`) under Domains, add the DNS records Resend shows (an MX and a TXT
SPF record on the `send` subdomain, and the DKIM TXT record `resend._domainkey`; a DMARC
TXT on `_dmarc` is recommended), wait for "Verified", then:

```bash
supabase secrets set RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxx
# optional
supabase secrets set FEEDBACK_EMAIL=bryan.wu.121@gmail.com FEEDBACK_FROM="vteam <feedback@vteamvolleyball.com>"
```

Until the domain is verified, Resend only accepts `onboarding@resend.dev` as the sender
and only delivers to the Resend account's own address, so `FEEDBACK_FROM="vteam <onboarding@resend.dev>"`
works for a first test if that account uses the destination address.

## `login-with-username`

Resolves a username to an email server-side and signs in through Supabase Auth's
password grant, returning only a session or a generic "Incorrect username or
password". It limits attempts itself (`public.check_rate_limit`: 30 per username
and 100 per IP every 15 minutes).

**IP forwarding (needed in production).** Every username sign-in reaches Supabase
Auth from this function, so Auth's own per-IP limit would otherwise treat all
users as one IP. To make Auth count each user's IP:

1. Settings → API Keys → *Publishable and secret API keys*: create the keys if the
   project has none. Supabase then provides `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEYS` to functions
   (the function uses the key named `default`).
2. Authentication → Rate Limits → **IP Address Forwarding**: enable it (or the
   management API: `PATCH /v1/projects/<ref>/config/auth` with
   `{"security_sb_forwarded_for_enabled": true}`).

With both, the function sends the password grant with the secret key and
`Sb-Forwarded-For: <caller IP>`. Without a secret key it falls back to the anon key
(no forwarding) and logs a warning.

## Deploying

From the repo root, logged in with `supabase login` and linked with
`supabase link --project-ref <ref>`:

```bash
supabase functions deploy send-chat-push
supabase functions deploy check-push-receipts
supabase functions deploy places-proxy
supabase functions deploy send-feedback-email
# or all at once:
supabase functions deploy
```

Deploy applies `verify_jwt` from `config.toml`. After the first deploy from this
config, check Dashboard → Edge Functions that the two push functions show JWT
verification off and `places-proxy` on.

Quick check of a deployed push function (expect `401`, then not `401`):

```bash
curl -i -X POST "https://<ref>.supabase.co/functions/v1/check-push-receipts"
curl -i -X POST "https://<ref>.supabase.co/functions/v1/check-push-receipts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
```
